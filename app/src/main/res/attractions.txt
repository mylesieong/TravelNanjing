Baixia Distinct>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
//Mingwalang (明瓦廊)

An offshoot from Nanjing’s busiest crossroads, Xinjiekou, the noisy, pungent and lively alleyway forks over a wide array of cook-before-your-eyes delicacies to leave even a seasoned gourmet spoilt for choice.

The roughly 200-meter road starts near Shigu Road with booths selling everything from grilled octopus skewers to fried chicken wings to egg pancakes.

Sauntering further down, there are a number of sit-down restaurants, each enjoying a legendary reputation in Nanjing.

YijiPidu Noodles serves massive bowls of noodles topped with sliced, deep-fried pig skin. Next to it, Bianrou Wonton boils Fujian-style purse-shaped dumplings with crunchy fillings. LaotouGai Jiao Fan is the stop for rice devotees.

South to Mingwalang is Daxianglu, a laid-back street-market with vendors pitching marinated duck necks or frying tofu skins from home stores.

//Wuchaomen Park (午朝门公园)

Every morning, retired locals practice tai chi, sing opera and walk backwards in circles in what was once the forbidden grounds of the Ming Palace.

Inside the park stands Wumen, one of Nanjing’s few remaining palace gates, dating back to 1367. Visitors can climb the grey-bricked structure to experience a good view over Yudao to the south, the straight and tree-lined former imperial road.

Wuchaomen is also ground zero for Nanjing’s saxophone association. Fans of the western instrument, mostly elderly retirees, gather here every day to chat and practice.

28 Yudao Road, Baixia District 白下区御道街27号; free; 6.30 a.m.-9.30 p.m.

//Jimmy’s

Hidden at the end of a food and drink complex on Shigu Road, this six-year-old sports bar plants a chunk of America in the heart of Nanjing.

Owned by Tennessee-native Jimmy, this laid-back pub is a nightlife stronghold among Nanjing expats, serving domestic and imported beers, a sociable environment and possibly the best American-style pizza in town.

Half a dozen TV sets are hung around the 100-square-metre brown-bricked space, broadcasting various sports games through international channels.

Beer costs around RMB 25 (US$) per bottle or RMB 30 (US$4.8) on tap. A 12-inch pizza is about RMB 85 (US$13.6).

//Sancho Panza

Local or international music bands strum out head-banging tunes every night at this subterranean space, connected to the real world by only a tiny flight of stairs in the Wutaishan Stadium complex.

Music genre varies from night to night but is largely focused on Rock, Country and Blues, according to the bartender. The underground live house is a regular stop for touring bands to set up shows in Nanjing.

It gets busy from around 9.00 p.m. when the daily concert starts. A pool table is tucked at the back of the bar for anyone who fancies a pre-concert warm-up.

//Florentina

It sounds surreal but it’s true: this cutely decorated house is the ultimate watering hole for Nanjing beer buffs.

The no-frills bar provides no food or live music, but bottle after bottle of good booze and a quiet environment for chatting. More than 100 imported brews are showcased neatly on a floor-to-ceiling shelf for selection. Most cost between RMB 25-40 (US$4-6.4).

The owner Tina Su (宿媛媛), a local in her mid-20s, says she opened this bar because she’d failed to find anything similar in Nanjing.

Ascend cloud high for a posh experience of juicy steaks, wonderful wines, premium cigars and a panoramic view over the glittering downtown at this InterContinental bar.

Located on the 78th floor of 450-meter Zifeng Tower, this 150-seat establishment is the highest nightlife spot in the city and is a safe bet for impressing even the pickiest of bosses or travelling partners.

The well-stocked wine cellar gathers 10 different Champagnes as well as 50 types of white wine and 100 red wines from Europe, Oceania and South America.

The cocktail menu leans towards fruity flavours and is designed by English mixologist Paul Mathew, who also edits DRiNK, a bilingual bar culture magazine in China. Drinks start from about RMB 68 (US$ 11) per glass plus 15 per cent.

//Plum Garden (梅苑)

No restaurant in town cooks better Huaiyang dishes, a regional cuisine from Nanjing and neighboring cities, than the Plum Garden. The 150-seat space in Jinling Hotel is where the local government sets up banquets for impressing visiting officials.

The layout and décor are exactly what you might expect of a classy Chinese restaurant: square mahogany chairs are placed carefully around big round tables covered with finely-woven tablecloths; potted pines and orchids adorn the marble-floored dining hall, which is divided into smaller sections by rosewood screens with exquisite carvings.

Most dishes are light-flavoured and beautifully presented. Salted duck chops, or yanshuiya (盐水鸭, RMB 198 or US$32 per duck), is a star starter. Must-try hot dishes include tofu cooked with crab meat (蟹粉豆腐, RMB 188 or US$30) and de-shelled shrimps fried with gingko fruit (银杏虾仁, RMB 188 or US$30).

//Nanjing Impressions (南京大排档)

Almost every Nanjinger recommends this chained restaurant for authentic local fare, reasonable prices and unique ambience.

Two male doormen wearing traditional Chinese dress welcome diners with nostalgic sales pitches. The buzzing dining hall is a nod to the late Qing Dynasty, with paper lanterns hung across the ceiling, waiters and chefs donning period costumes and artists singing local opera.

Some 10 open kitchens occupy one side of the room. Cooks busy themselves from boiling sweet sticky-rice dumplings to frying stinky tofu to garnishing duck blood soup.

Customers can either walk around the kitchens and order directly from the chefs or sit down and call for a waiter.

Signature dishes include steamed dumplings stuffed with duck meat (天王烤鸭包, RMB 12 or US$1.9 for three pieces), yanshuiya (RMB 28 or US$4.5 per plate) and mini-pork dumplings in duck soup (老鸭汤小馄饨, RMB 12 or US$1.9 per bowl).

//Yanyangtian (艳阳天)

Numbing and spicy Sichuan cuisine is extremely popular in Nanjing, and this is where expert eaters get their monthly pepper doses.

The mid-range eatery spans two neighbouring houses. One of them contains only individual dining rooms; the other has a massive 20-table dining hall as well as private sections.

The menu includes both iconic Sichuanese fare, such as sliced beef in chilli oil (水煮牛肉, RMB 48 or US$7.7) and steamed chicken with chilli sauce (口水鸡, RMB 28 or US$4.5), as well as fusion creations like sautéed shrimp kebabs (串烤大虾, RMB 108 or US$17.3). All dishes are big enough to feed three to four people.

It’s advisable to book for a dinner table at least one day in advance. Lunchtime, by comparison, is less crowded and much quieter.

Qinhuai Distinct>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
//Qinhuai Renjia (秦淮人家)

Eating in this two-story venue is strange but fun. After ordering from a menu full of set combos, waiters bring in more than a dozen small dishes, each holding a different snack, until the table is heaving with porcelain pots.

The star of the plate-driven feast is Qinhuai Eight Treasures (秦淮八绝), a dining concept featuring eight pairs of iconic eats that originated along the Qinhuai River. The 16 nibbles – half are dry dishes, others wet – are coupled by the restaurant to achieve the best gastronomic effect.

Examples of the delicious duos are shredded tofu in chicken broth served with a sesame pancake, and pan-fried beef dumplings paired with beef soup.

The restaurant is located in one of the best locations in Nanjing – looking directly at Confucius Temple over the water and the hustle and bustle of the Fuzimiao area.

No. 128 Dashiba Road, Qinhuai District 秦淮区大石坝街128号; +86 25 5221 1888; open daily 11.00 a.m.-1:30 p.m., 5.00 p.m.-8:30 p.m.; combos from RMB 198-598 (US$31.8-96) depending on accompanying side dishes

//Confucius Temple (夫子庙)

In this tourist magnet also known as Fuzi Miao, eating is just as important as worshipping the great philosopher.

Squeeze into these ever-humming lanes to spot small but reputable shops, specializing in the snacks that express the city’s history.

Highlights include the dumplings in sweet red-bean soup from Lianhu Rice Cake Shop (莲湖糕团店), sesame pancakes from Qifangge (奇芳阁) and tofu jelly from Liufengju (六凤居).

Numerous self-serving open-kitchen canteens along the main road, GongyuanJie (贡院街), put most of the city’s signature dishes under one roof.

Two time-honored restaurants Wan Qing Lou (晚晴楼) and QinhuaiRenjia (秦淮人家)are dedicated to serving the Qinhuai Eight Treasures (秦淮八绝), a snack banquet featuring eight pairs of iconic nibbles that originated along Qinhuai River.

Delivering top-notch cocktails and fine service in a cosy environment, the 50-square-metre bar is the place to go for a classy sip outside glitzy hotels.

The menu comprises simple finger food and some 50 drinks choices with different bases of liquor, including whiskey, vodka, gin and tequila.

Waist-coated Chinese bartenders, trained by the bar’s Japanese owner, mix concoctions in front of a large wall of alcohol which displays more than 100 bottles of firewater from around the world.

//Xuanwu Lake Park (玄武湖公园)

Just a few steps away from commercial thoroughfares, this former imperial lake garden ushers city dwellers from the urban hustle and bustle into a peaceful haven of weeping willows, arch bridges, paddle boats and visually stunning flowers.

Whatever the season, the 4.4 square-kilometre park showcases a distinctive colour: pink cherry blossoms in spring, emerald lotus leaves in summer, golden ginkgos and red maples in autumn, and snow-covered pines in winter.

Much of Nanjing’s downtown is built around this massive, smooth body of water. A casual stroll around the lake and through its five islands – all connected by bridges -- can take up to five hours.

Various gates. The main one is Xuanwu Gate, near Metro Line 1 Xuanwumen Station; free; open daily 6.00 a.m.-8.00 p.m.; round-the-lake sightseeing bus RMB 30 (US$4.80) per person per trip
